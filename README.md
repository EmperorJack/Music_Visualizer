# Music-Visualizer
Real-time Audio Visualizer coded in Processing. Models made in Maya.

~Background~
For a creative coding project I had to build a data visualization based on audio data. I created a music visualizer aimed at electronic dance music. I drew inspiration from realtime visualizers such as the Apple Itunes or Windows Media Player designs.
 
I worked with particles and 3D geometry to creative a dynamic design that is mesmerising and composes well in 3D space.

~Installation~
- Download the project zip.
- Requires Processing: https://processing.org/
- Make sure you are using a form of Stereo-Mix (records PC output audio as input stream).
- Open the sketch via the "Music-Visualizer.pde".
- Run the sketch.

~Usage~
- Press the D key to toggle display of statistical overlay.
- Press the H key to toggle display of documentation.
- The space key can be used to toggle the visualizer state at any time.
